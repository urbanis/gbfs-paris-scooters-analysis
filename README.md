# Micromobility Spatiotemporal Analysis in Paris :kick_scooter:

![TimeFrames](time_Frames.gif)

This project represents the Spatiotemporal Anaysis of Micromobility in Paris.

Lime, one of the operators in Paris, provides mobility data by the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS). GBFS provides local authorities and agencies with a standardized way to ingest, analyze, and compare data generated by shared mobility systems.

A scrapping script was developed to consume the GBFS data from the Operator “Lime”, specifically, the file “free_bike_status.json” which describes all the vehicles (scooters and e-bikes) that are not by the moment in active rental. The information was acceded by the open data portal of the French Ministry of Transport and Lime’s API (https://data.lime.bike/api/partners/v2/gbfs/paris/gbfs.json).

#  Spatiotemporal Analysis

* Equitable geographical distribution of the scooters
* Density parked scooters during the day by hour
* Percentage change of parked scooters by time frames
* Usage of public space by the scooters
* Compliance with “non parking”/ “no scooters” areas regulations

# About GBFS
The General Bikeshare Feed Specification, known as GBFS, is the open data standard for shared mobility. GBFS makes real-time data feeds in a uniform format publicly available online, with an emphasis on findability. GBFS is intended to make information publicly available online; therefore information that is personally identifiable is not currently and will not become part of the core specification. For more information [follow this link](https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs).

# GBFS Limitations
* To guarantee personal privacy, the identification number of the vehicles in GBFS are not statical, they change in various scenarios, so there is no direct way to recreate origin-destinations patterns.
* The data only show non-rented devices, in other words, if a vehicle is actively being used, it is not registered.
*  GPS precision is a constraint to properly determine on a big scale, the proper location of the vehicles. For example, to determine if the vehicle is on the sidewalk or in the street.
* It is not possible to access to personal data of the users like gender, age, address, to enrich the analysis.
